# Aptos Auction House
A decentralized auction house for rare alcohol bottles built on the Aptos blockchain.
    *Overview*
This repository contains the source code for the Aptos Auction House, a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to buy and sell rare alcohol bottles in a secure and transparent manner. The dApp uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to prove ownership of the bottles and provides a fair and transparent auction process.
    *Features*
- Decentralized auction house: Buy and sell rare alcohol bottles in a secure and transparent manner.
- NFT-based ownership: Each bottle is associated with a unique NFT, which proves ownership and allows for secure transfer.
- Fair and transparent auction process: Auctions are conducted in a fair and transparent manner, with bids recorded on the blockchain.
- Access control: Only authorized users can create and manage auctions.
